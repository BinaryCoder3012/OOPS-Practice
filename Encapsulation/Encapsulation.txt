Encapsulation is the process of data hiding in which the internal data of a class
is hidden from the outside world.

It is the mechanism of wrapping data members (attributes) and the methods that
operate on them into a single unit called a class.

Encapsulation helps in:
- Improving security
- Achieving modularity
- Increasing code reusability
- Improving maintainability

Encapsulation is implemented in Java using:
- private data members
- public getter and setter methods

Example:
private int salary;
public int getSalary()
public void setSalary(int salary)


Code:

import java.util.*;
class BankAcc {
    private String accNumber;
    private double balance;  // private data members (data hiding)
    public void setDetails(String accNumber, double balance) {//setter
        this.accNumber = accNumber;
        this.balance = balance;
    }
    public String getAccNumber() { //getter
        return accNumber;
    }
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}

public class Encapsulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAcc account = new BankAcc();
        account.setDetails("ABCD", 25000.50);
        System.out.println("ACCOUNT NUMBER : " + account.getAccNumber());
        System.out.printf("BALANCE : %.2f%n", account.getBalance());
    }
}
